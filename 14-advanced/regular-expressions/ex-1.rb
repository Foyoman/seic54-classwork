# ARGF is an array of all the lines of all the files mentioned in ARGV

# [10] Make a program that prints each line of its input that mentions fred. (It shouldnâ€™t do anything for other lines of input.) Does it match if your input string is Fred, frederick, or Alfred? Make a small text file with a few lines mentioning "fred flintstone" and his friends, then use that file as input to this program and the ones later in this section.
ARGF.each do |line|
	puts line if line =~ /\bfred\b/
